Steam Authentication & Integration
  A XenForo Addon

== Description ==
This addon provides Steam Integration allowing new & existing users to establish
accounts via their Steam accounts. This is similar to the Twitter (New) plugin
which adds no custom template code by hand and instead properly creates
templates and implements them using hooks.

== Prerequisites ==
 * cURL
 * BCMath (PHP Extension, usually installed already)

== Installation Steps ==
    1. Install Prerequisites
         CentOS / Redhat:
           * yum install php-bcmath

         Debian / Ubuntu:
           * apt-get install php5-curl

    2. Upload files in the upload directory to your forum
    3. Make the folder "js/steam/cache" world writable (chmod 0777)
    4. Install using the provided "addon-Steam.xml"
    5. Change options for "Steam Integration" as necessary

== Features ==
 * Single Sign On / Authentication via Steam
 * Statistics
 * Notices

== Need Help? ==
Glad you've decided to use Steam Authentication and Integration, but please do
not ask me directly for help via a Conversation. We are all working on building
our communities so unless you have sensitive information to share (which you
shouldn't share with me anyways) then don't make a conversation and instead post
in the discussion!

  Steps to take BEFORE asking for help:
    * Read your log files!
      Don't know where they are or what they mean? Well then this is a good
      time to research. You should be familiar with your forums environment
      before installing an addon (and if you are not, you should become familiar
      or consider contracting the work).

    * Read your log files!
      Pretty please???

    * Read the entire description & readme file!
      They contain instructions and hints which you may have missed or need to
      do before you can continue!

    * Read the discussions! (available on the XenForo Community / Releases)
      Someone else probably already had the same exact issue...go hunt through
      the thread to see if that is the case.

    * Ask your question in the discussion!
      I'll answer any questions there, and if you start a conversation asking
      for help with your installation, I'll only tell you to post in the
      discussion thread. I will respond in the discussion I promise!

== Like this Addon? ==
Awesome! Leave a review and tell me how much you like it and why! Feedback is
important so you might as well give it so those who develop for this addon can
make it better and others can see your opinions.

== Common Issues (and fixes) ==
  * Invalid profile data
    This occurs when the AJAX calls fail when using the "steamprofile" library.
    Check your error log to set the appropriate permissions but likely files in
    the "js" folder are writable.

  * How do I migrate from other Steam Integration Addons?
    Uninstalling the previous addon usually leaves Steam as an external
    authentication source if you look in xf_user_external_auth after you
    uninstall your users will still have Steam listed). Then you'll want to
    also remove the custom field you created for the older add-on as it is no
    longer used then follow the install process. It will use the existing data
    stored within the xf_user_external_auth table so once you've completed the
    migration your users will likely not notice the change.

    Also, you'll need to revert any templates you had to change such as the part
    for the login_bar. You should just reference the old addons install steps to
    find exactly what to remove.
